I am a freelance journalist, based in Gothenburg (Sweden).
I worked as a newsreporter at The South Swedish, Sydsvenskan, a daily newspaper in the Swedish county of Scania.
I am originally from Burkina Faso, where I worked for several years as a journalist, including as editor-in-chief of Burkina24 and, later, as a contributor to Le Monde Afrique.
